# Dundee Township - Illinois, USA
Assets for the Dundee Townships' <em>Not-an-Inc. - a Directory for the Rest of Us</em>

This is an <em>exclusive</em> project, in the sense that only individuals, home-based businesses, garage and basement shops are included. Household brands, national chains and established local businesses do not need our resources, and they are excluded from our projects.

We also do not accept "sponcorships", to ensure that our purpose and our conduct is not influenced.

Most of the resources are documented under the Projects, although not everything maybe kept on Github, or online... Not-an-Inc. has more physcial than intellectual properties, and this is not a "software" project.

Please stay tuned while the first Projects are published, and our purpose and processes are explained.
